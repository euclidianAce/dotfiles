# My Configs
This repo is mostly so that I have a remote location to update my configs on my laptops

# Apps and such
The configs I keep track of here are for

- AwesomeWM
- Firefox/Librewolf
- Git
- Neovim
- Nushell
- Tmux
- Wezterm
- Xresources
- Zathura

Along with:

- A nushell script to do symlinking/copying
- Fancy prompt thingy: prompt.zig
- My colorscheme in tsv format
- Random nix-shells
