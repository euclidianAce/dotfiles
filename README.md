# My Configs
This repo is mostly so that I have a remote location to update my configs on my laptops

# Apps and such
The configs I keep track of here are for

- AwesomeWM
- Zathura
- Bash
	- both my .bashrc and my PS1 script to make it look nice: ps1Getter.c
- Neovim
- tmux
- st
	- patched to load a lua config in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/st/rc.lua`
